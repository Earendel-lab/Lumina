# 🔦 Lumina

**Lumina** is a clean, expressive, and privacy-focused flashlight application designed with **Material 3** principles. It delivers a native app-like experience directly in your browser with zero bloat and absolute privacy.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Trust Commitment
The most important feature of **Lumina** is what it **does not** do:
* **NO Camera Recording:** While the app requests "Camera" permissions, this is technically required by mobile browsers to access the hardware LED (Flashlight). Lumina **never** activates the camera sensor, captures images, or records video.
* **NO Data Collection:** There are no trackers, no cookies, and no analytics.
* **NO Cloud Connectivity:** Lumina runs entirely on your local device.

**Lumina is 100% private by design.**

## ✨ Key Features

* **Blink Mode (Strobe):** A tactile, expressive slider to adjust blink frequency from 1Hz to 20Hz.
* **Screen Glow:** A full-screen white-out mode for soft lighting, featuring a minimal "Tap to Close" interface.
* **Material 3 Design:** Features "Expressive" motion, squircle-to-circle morphing, and a pure black OLED-ready theme.
* **Full Screen Experience:** Optimized to blend with your device's status bar and navigation gestures.
